    <h1>IT Work: Interview with Jay</h1>
    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p> Due to company policies, we can only reveal his first name which is Jay. His official job title is offensive security manager.
As someone who works in the cybersecurity department, this is where you "make sure all the information systems that we work on, or applications are secure." Jay works on the offensive side so this is where you "pretend to be the attacker and try and attack the systems and applications". As a manager in the cybersecurity sector there lots of people you would have to interact with, but the important ones would be the stakeholders so the business stakeholders, technical stakeholders, and there's risk stakeholders. Jay works with them to help determine what issues need to be fixed, and what issues don't necessarily need to be fixed. A challenging thing about the cybersecurity industry would be staying up to date with the "staying up to date with the evolving nature of IT". So, staying up to date with the changing threat landscape is quite a challenge since every day new ways or techniques are being discovered and it’s his job to explore all those ways and make sure there is a way to have protection against it
</p>
<p>The work that best capture Jay's essence of IT industries would be "trying to see if we can use technology to simplify manually work or have things that may not need when you work." So, with all technology Jay's job is to help secure it. In recent times Jays has been working with crypto and cloud storage and since the company he works for wants to implement those technologies he had to work and make sure that technology is secure. Another big one would be mobile, but this has been around for the past "five to seven years" and most of it has been established. Working in the cybersecurity department has its "good days and bad days" but besides that Jay loves his job, loves working with people, loves working with technology. "there's a lot of meetings and admin and, you know business meetings that I have to go" which is the one-part Jay doesn't really enjoy "but overall, it's good." Jay recommends to those who want to go down the cybersecurity career pathway is to make sure you have passion and the willingness not to give up as in the IT industry there are lots of changes, so the willingness not to give up but to continue would be key. Problem-solving, patience, and communication skills are just some other skills that would be suitable for the position. But other than skills ways to improve your cybersecurity practice would be to try out: Cybersecurity clubs, Capture the flag events, Hack the box, Try to hack me; practising the willingness to learn through these activities
