        <h3>Raspberry Pi</h3>
        <p>Raspberry Pi’s, Arduninos, Makey Makeys, etc. Are small computing devices that can come in different forms. These devices are either made up of a circuit board, microcontroller or a minicomputer.  Out of these the minicomputer variant is the best. As microcontrollers have far fewer available resources compared to minicomputers. But which device you want may vary for what the intended function is. As of now the best minicomputer there is, is the Intel NUC and the runner up being the UDOO BOLT. However, both options are very pricey. Intel NUC is essentially a whole desktop computer in a mini form factor depending on if you’re going to get the prebuilt Intel NUC minicomputer or just the Intel NUC board. A bare Intel NUC board can go from upwards of $330 USD, and a prebuilt board can be $1,029 USD and over. While Intel NUC are the best minicomputers out there, you don’t necessarily need it if a Raspberry Pi 4 valued at around $90 USD can be used instead. Minicomputers such as Raspberry Pi’s can do a lot of things. As of now a Raspberry Pi can essentially do many things that a normal desktop computer can normally do. Like a desktop computer it of course needs to be plugged into a monitor of sorts and needs a keyboard and mouse to function. Raspberry Pi’s can also be used to learn coding/programming and be used in many projects. Projects such as replacing your desktop computer, emulating a Gameboy, creating an AI or DIY smart assistant (Amazon Echo), controlling a robot, hooking it up to a monitor to display computer hardware status or to create a smart tv, an intruder alarm with the use of a laser sensor, a cheaper network-attached-storage device, as well as something our team is already currently looking into a Smart Mirror. There are many more prospects that a minicomputer can do. Essentially every electronic device or gadget can be made or improved with a small computing device. Theoretically you could automate almost any object or process with a computing device.
        <br>
        <p>In the future new and better computing devices will come out and unlock more possibilities. For example, the upcoming Raspberry Pi 5. Computing devices such as Raspberry Pi’s are used in the Internet of Things (IoT) industry and serve as a good replacement and solution to data centers and edge computing. Edge computing is a viable solution to cloud storage. As the Raspberry Pi’s run the process locally compared to the AI process of the norm of data centers, thus reducing latency. Also due to the fact the data center isn’t run by cloud-based AI, this also resolves “many problems and concerns” that AI-run systems have (“The Future of Single Board Computers and Artificial Intelligence”, 1 Aug 2019). However, our current computing devices aren’t powerful and fast enough to efficiently run these processes.  The Raspberry Pi 4 “is a potential candidate for edge-computing applications”. However, it does not locally come with an “AI co-processor, so all AI algorithms must run on the CPU” (“The Future of Single Board Computers and Artificial Intelligence”, 1 Aug 2019). In the future though, many single board computers and other computing devices could come embedded with AI or at least a “minimum level of intelligence” (“The Future of Single Board Computers and Artificial Intelligence”, 1 Aug 2019). Furthermore, with the slow global adaptation of 5G, and how it's driving the future of the Internet of Things and edge computing. With major strides in improvement of single board computers/minicomputers, 5G adoption and edge computing. Combining all of these could essentially move and improve the Internet of Things. Technological fields such as AR and VR technology could be dominated by single board computers with devices such as smart glasses and virtual reality headsets. Other fields such as robotics/drones and telemedicine will be widely affected by the improvement and adoption of 5G, edge computing and computing devices. With existing and new computing devices already out there and being made. Many physical objects in the real world could and may as well eventually be connected to the internet. Which is essentially the process of the Internet of Things. For example, simple items in your household that wouldn’t normally have any outside functionality apart from their primary purpose could eventually be linked to the internet. Objects such as one’s coffee machine or even their shower could be linked to the network. Other technological advancements in robotics and other Internet of thing related fields further push the capabilities of computing devices. Also, the components of these small computing devices further improve and also unlock more potential from them. As these small computing devices get better CPUs and RAM further pushing performance, better connection through Bluetooth or WI-FI, and storage either getting bigger or faster in terms of reading and writing speeds. In addition to, the integration of better ports such as the new standard of USB Type-C or USB 3.0. These newer and better components further develop the proficiency and power these devices hold.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>Small computing devices such as Raspberry Pi’s and their vast improvements would affect many entities of our society. The importance and growth of small computing devices will likely be an upward trend. One of the main fields that small computing devices will likely affect is industrial automation. As computing devices such as “single board computers have important applications in industrial automation and are used primarily for process control and discrete manufacturing in production facilities.” (Single Board Computer Market Competitive Landscape, Trends, Market Concentration Rate, Business Strategies, 2021)  Robotics has also pushed the development of industrial automation and computing devices in turn also has impacted the field of robotics. Many prospects would be subject to change with the impact of these developments surrounding computing devices.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>Fields such as medicine could be impacted with the introduction of robotic assisted surgery, more advanced prosthetics, AI doctors and nurses, and other helpful and lifesaving technologies. However, developments in industrial automation and the like would also result “in reducing the overall cost of manufacturing through increased productivity and efficiency.” (Single Board Computer Market Competitive Landscape, Trends, Market Concentration Rate, Business Strategies, 2021) This could also in turn make some jobs redundant. For example, warehouses and factories that were normally run by humans would now be controlled and run autonomously. Where this would lead to redundancy of warehouse and factory workers, new jobs would be created. As the machines and robotics of these warehouses and factories aren’t perfect like us and can break down. Occupations such as robotics mechanics, technicians and engineers would have more demand and marketspace. The further progression and development of small computing devices would essentially affect every single person. Due to the fact that eventually almost all physical objects could somehow be connected to the Internet of Things. No matter who you are or what you're doing, small computing devices will make their way into people’s lives. As more smart devices and objects become adopted and come into practice. But the most affected population could be people with a lower education level as the jobs that don’t require much educational expertise could be automated. However, the progression of this technology could produce more occupations than it makes redundant. People in the field of the Internet of things would most likely also be affected heavily by the evolution of small computing devices. As this would in turn also advance the development of IoT systems. The internet and telecommunications of our society could change and develop with the growth of computing devices.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>I believe that the evolution of small and single computing devices will heavily affect not only my daily life. But it could also heavily affect the lives of my friends and family. I feel that my daily life would be swamped with the adoption of many smart devices that could result in home automation. These devices being smart doors, smart kitchen sinks, smart showers, smart lawnmowers and way more automated devices that you wouldn’t think of being automated. I think smart devices could greatly enhance my life and perhaps increase my productivity. But there will always be the feeling of anxiety and creepiness with smart devices, due to security concerns and general unease. One of these concerns for example is the hacking of a smart home camera in December of 2019. Where a family “said they installed the device to keep an eye on their daughters. A few days later, the family said a stranger had gained access to the device and was talking to the girl” and also “taunted their 8 year old” ((Minyvonne Burke (2019). “Man hacks Ring camera in 8-year-old girl’s bedroom, taunts her: ‘I’m Santa Claus’”. NBC News.) Security concerns such as this where strangers gain access to the device and the data generated by the user is very dangerous. As if the data leaks for example you could predict when a person isn’t home or when that person is sleeping. It also raises many other concerns such as ethical or privacy concerns. As you could just watch anyone in your home, or you wouldn’t know if the companies behind these devices are watching you. However past ethical, moral, privacy and security concerns. Smart devices would make my life more convenient I believe. With things like better and portable health sensors built into your smart watch that could monitor my families’ vitals and whether or not they need a checkup. It could also heavily reduce the work needed to be done around the house that I and my family have to do with cleaning robots and smart kitchens giving the family more free time to do other pressing matters.

        <h3>Clouds, services, servers</h3>
        <p>Cloud computing is used every day around the world in many aspects of IT and daily life so much so that most people don’t even realise it. Cloud computing are services that are delivered over the internet such as storing data and information, software usage, data analytics, databases and many more. Companies which require IT infrastructure such as data centres can instead rent access to these through cloud service providers rather than having to purchase and maintain their own infrastructure. Many services that you currently use are also cloud services such as Google’s Gmail and Google Drive which both store data and information and on which the user can opt to pay for access to more storage space, Dropbox, Office365, etc. These days cloud computing has advanced so widely that you can even play modern video games on your phone by streaming the game from your PC from anywhere at any time using software such as Steam link. A major player in the cloud computing space is Amazon web services, they provide cloud services for many different categories including Advertising and Marketing, Financial services, Media and entertainment, Data analytics, machine learning, Applications and storage and gaming. Amazon Web Services or AWS, Google Cloud and Microsoft Azure are 3 services that are largely considered state of the art when it comes to cloud computing. AWS is the most popular of the 3 services and holds the highest market share due to its large and highly competitive offers with many different available services for every need and use. Google cloud is highly popular for its machine learning capabilities and is also well known for their expertise in open source and last but not least, Azure offers safe ‘tried-and-true’ services and is often the go to service for experts and professionals with long standing experience in cloud computing.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>While cloud computing is still in its infancy stage it’s potential for growth is exceeding and some of advancements that we will see in the near future will allow for even more rapid growth of the adoption of cloud computing. The future of cloud computing holds many promising innovations some of the expected improvements in the near future include low latency streaming over cloud, faster and better serverless computing and better availability of quantum computing over the cloud. The advancements that make these innovations in cloud computing possible include the improvement of computer processing speeds and technologies such as already seen in recent years and the improvement of the recent invention of quantum computers which utilise quantum physics to create computers that can be faster and can computer more at a time than classical computers. Furthermore, the recent events of Covid-19 has forced many businesses and enterprises to adopt cloud-based solutions to survive and sustain themselves further accelerating the growth and adoption of cloud computing in personal and business-based environments. However, cloud computing does have its downsides; there are many risks associated with cloud computing especially for those who use it to store highly sensitive data and information as they are vulnerable to data loss and theft, data leakage, hijackings and DDOS all of which can compromise the integrity of the data stored on the servers of cloud services, therefore it is necessary to be constantly improving and innovating on the security and the recovery and restoration of data and services and even the hardware used to store the data in data-centres.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>According to Gartner, Cloud services are expected to grow by 21.7% by the end of 2022 and predicts that 45% of enterprise IT spending will be on cloud computing, this highlights the importance of cloud services for the future of IT and businesses and its rapid growth surely means that IT experts and professionals will have to adapt to their usage, staying up to date with information and news about cloud computing and new innovations. While this technology is great for many businesses with this rapid growth, it’s possible that many jobs will be made unnecessary especially those that maintain and develop servers ‘in-house’ for individual clients, businesses, and companies but they won’t be entirely removed as it’s hard to imagine that cloud computing will entirely eliminate the need for local networks and on-site data storage solutions which are currently still the most dominant means of computing. Clearly the people that will be most affected are those that work in the IT industry as well as business owners and companies as the widespread adoption of cloud computing will reduce the cost of setup and maintenance for individuals, businesses and companies which will allow for greater innovation in other industries and areas by helping to reduce the factor of cost in projects and therefore allowing assets to be allocated elsewhere to improve the quality of products and services in the short term and long term.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>Access to these cloud services allows smaller companies and individuals to produce better products and services while reducing the costs of maintenance and upkeep and eliminating the significant cost of setting up the necessary infrastructure in the first place.</p>

        <h3>Robots</h3>
        <p>Robots are human made machinery that could be programmed to do what we desired to reduce our efforts and make things easier. Robots and AI are two different things people always get mix up with, the difference between the two is that one is an intelligent program that doesn't need a physical body so for example Siri, Alexa and even google(home) etc... Whereas robots are machine which are design for a specific job, requiring a physical body to achieve its task not needing intelligence to complete its job so like the roomba, Boston Dynamics spot the robot etc.Currently robots are not in wide usage, we are yet to see any new advancement to robots for  home usage. The only such robot that are domestically sold and in household are the robot vacuum, this is the only such robot that are widely sold and used. There are other robots sold for domestic usage yet not frequently bought or talked about, yet there are other cleaning robots that could help around but nothing too advanced yet. New robot technology is being developed; Boston Dynamics has been developing robots used in dangerous environments so it would keep people out of harms way by using robots instead. Such examples could be inspecting suspicious packages for the police department and even potential military usage.
        Presently the robots now can only do simple task and doesn't have much functionality therefore not many robots are being advance for home usage and therefore only basic cleaning robots are in use but not commonly. With future advancements robots could but used in a wider capacity but with the limitations of current technology and materials not many improvements could be made, therefore the lack of robots being made and manufactured.
        There are lots of possibilities on what would most likely be done over the next 3 years in regard to advancements in robot technology or usage in robots in general. Boston Dynamics did mention "the not too distance future" (Boston Dynamics, 2021) so in the next three year the use of 'spot' could potentially be used for commercial uses so robot dog could be used as a walking companion keeping people active and company as they go on their runs. I believe over the course of the three years the prices of the robots would decrease allow more customers to purchase the piece of machinery which will encourage the new age of robots and their usefulness around the house.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>With the current hardware limitation, we can only go so far, yet it is an improvement from over the years. The advancement of robots only comes from the improvements of different hardware, other technology as well as better programming scrips. So, with our current technology Boston Dynamics was able to 3D print their robot parts which makes the robot quicker, lighter, and more reliable, this is how they are able to eliminate the big pipe which is used for hydraulics fluids. By improving the robots it would pave the way for future designs and models. Over the years robot designs have change drastically so in the later years engineers are able to compact their robots into smaller and portable designs, for example the first irobot roomba prototype which was created in 2002 was much taller then it current build, but over time with new technology such as wireless connection, more powerful batteries and sense allows the irobot roomba to be what it is currently a more compact and smart robot that could vacuum the floor and empty itself. What makes present day robots possible would be certain materials used, with 3D printing it provides precise shapes and strong, light weight pieces that would over all improve the robot. It all comes down to what robots are created and their purpose, and whether or not it would benefit mankind or replace us. If more robots are created for more domestic usages, it would impact our lives drastically in a positive way as things such as chores or small task could easily be solved by robots. But developing robots to replace labour work on the production line would have a drastic negative impact on our lives. If robot development continue it has the potential to replace people's job this can already be seen in some car factory where they would use robots (so like robot arms) to assemble the cars or weld parts onto the car. The people mostly affected by robots would be labours, as their jobs are mostly physical works, whereas robots could eliminate humans by doing the physically straining jobs and doing it better and efficient.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
        One major negative would be an automated production line by using robots. Despite an automated production line being beneficial to the company that implemented the robots as it wastes no time doing what its programmed to since robots doesn't require a holiday, have sick days, or get paid overtime, all that the robot needs are to be serviced and repaired every now and then. The people whose job it is to work on the production line would be caught in the crossfire, if robots replaced them and their jobs it would cause major consequences as many people would lose their job, their main and only source of income.
        But with current robot designs and technology robots wouldn't be replacing peoples’ jobs anytime soon as the current robots can only do basic task and cannot fully do every task a human can do. Therefore, people still have their jobs yet in the far future it is a possibility that robots would make certain jobs redundant. With the robots we have now it doesn't affect me too much as my average day doesn't require robot assistance. My day just consist of waking up by an alarm, walking to the train station attend class and going home right after those classes, and same thing again. Robots wouldn't make much of a impact currently besides help vacuum the house which is one advantage that isn't too much of an impact as the irobot roomba cannot vacuum the whole house fast enough like a human does, only small scraps in small spaces. But if the development of robots has improved then that is a different story as robots would have a drastic effect on me and how I go about my day. On the bright side robots would achieve easy but time-consuming task such as house chore, so tasks such as vacuuming, mopping or even cooking. These robots would free up time and allow us to enjoy our hobbies, own time without having to waste time doing simple jobs.So, with the development of new and advance robots it could have negative effects on the general public as well as affect members of my family immensely as it has the chance to take over my parent’s jobs. So, if robot technology has improved then my mum’s job would be made redundant as she works on an assembly line making sure all the product is up to standard. So, with robot intervention it would leave her and many others jobless, this is reflected onto my daily life as many of the things I would do daily could easily be affected by robots.In some cases, robots could act indirectly and be in the background, not directly affecting me but at the same time affecting the lives of others and potentially members of my family. So, jobs like cleaning the trains when it arrives at the station, robots could replace humans and could do a better job with it, which again would decrease the number of jobs available.

        <h3>Language processing</h3>
        <p>Chatterbots are applications that consists of Artificial Intelligence and Natural Language Processing (referred to as NLP) designed to breakdown what end user inputs and directs them towards the outcome that they want. Often, they will analyze the request and identify context and intent before composing a reply. Natural Language Processing, according to encora.com, “is a form of AI that gives machines the ability to not just read, but to understand and interpret human language. With NLP, machines can make sense of written or spoken text and perform tasks including speech recognition, sentiment analysis, and automatic text summarization.” (Encora, 2021.). Currently, the recent stage in development of chatterbots and NLP can be summarized and conceptualized within Google’s LaMDA  which stands for “Language Model for Dialogue Applications.” which demonstrated its complexity at Google I/O 2021 which reflected its ability to create intriguing conversations in full lengths with randomized topics, this is known as open-domain dialogue. Chatbots and NGLs have been used extensively to guide end users in various language-based tasks; summarizing documents, translating them into other languages or answering specific question related to information-seeking.  Open domain dialogue was seen as complicated due to the open-ended challenges and the ever-growing requirement to be flexible in application, this also included those responses made by the program had to justifiable under the given context. However, Google LaMDA’s recent developments in 2021 has paved the way to safe, grounded, high-quality dialogue applications (Google AI Blog, 2022). Google’s CEO Sundar Pichai displayed a demo of LaMDA impersonating Pluto and a paper plane as two different conversations. In order to create meaning conversations with its users, it used its training data which consisted of learned concepts and a dataset of SentencePiece tokens to generate a multitude of responses that could accomplish its targets. It demonstrated the aforementioned qualities: sensibleness, specifity, interestingness, and factuality (Romero, 2021). It has unlocked new avenues for comprehending benefits and risks of open-ended dialog agents with the set AI principles (Google AI Blog, 2022). This indicates what chatbots are now capable of which is a wide variety of tasks with some human guidance or assistance.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>Currently what can be done with chatbots is automation and handling of simple tasks and providing support to end users whether its internal or external. Due to the impact of Covid in 2020 and 2021, there has been an increase in uses chatbots and as such, more possibilities are becoming real in coming years. “Economic competitive pressure has driven companies to rely on Ai to automate decision making” (Landbot.io, 2020) and with functions such as speech to text, language recognition and translation, speaker recognition, content moderation, text analytics and much more; most industries could involve themselves with the applications of chatterbots. Customer service and intent recommendation could see chatterbots being used in online shopping, marketing and even customer support, involving itself through all customer touchpoints. There has also been indication that chatterbots could be used for mental health services such as aiding those individuals who are reluctant due to stigmatization or even fear; currently it’s been used for training, therapy and screening. (Abd-alrazaq et al., 2019). Some emerging trends that involve NLP have allowed Chatbots to grow, these include: AI chatbot apps, Virtual assistances, Customer service and analytics. Google’s LaMDA was built upon other language models like Google’s BERT, Meena and GPT-3, all based on Transformer which is a neural network architecture designed and development by Google in 2017 which has allowed for such developments to reach the current state of advancement. Usage of tokenizers which is essentially is words broken down into subwords and then complied as packages with IDs to be scanned with a look up table has also allowed for the growth of NPL and chatterbots such as SentencePiece and WordPiece.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>The potential impact of the recent development for chatterbots and NLP has created a market and foundation for more extensive and complex usage.  With many transnational corporations implementing chatbots for customer and business support such as Ebay, LinkedIn and Starbucks, users are in constant demand for round-the-clock service; with “nearly 40% of internet users worldwide prefer interacting with chatbots than virtual agents, chatbots will likely increase in popularity moving forward.” (Yuen, 2022).  Google’s LaMDA has indicted what the future of chatbots could become and how involved they could be with our daily lives. We will likely see more widespread usage of chatbots to handle basic tasks and queries without the guidance of a human to affirm decisions made. Since there numerous platforms each with various contexts and data, specific chatbots could be built to help in any setting from retailers to banking and finance to entertainment and travel to medical emergencies and healthcare. This growth would create jobs designed to regulate, maintain and update chatbots and report on its feedback and gathered data. However, this would also mean the end of smaller jobs such as call center jobs and administration. Not that those particular kinds of jobs would be completely ruled out but there would be overall less reliance towards them since they would have usually handled tasks that could possibly be automatized. Yet, chatbots are not the entire solution at the moment; current models are unable to carry all queries or adjust to answer specifically and most are not as fast as Google’s LaMDA and could vary in implementation and pre-training. It is also expected that chatterbots will not remove humans from the equation but rather assist them since human skills such as adaptability and creative are far beyond the capacity of current models without being difficult to maintain as LaMDA.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>In accordance to daily life, chatterbots and NPL could affect everyday life towards improving it and creating efficient experiences with small tasks. Chatterbots could be involved in most aspects of everyday scenarios from shopping, work and organization, and even household chores. What will be different will be how we approach simple tasks that do not require creative responses and are just repetitive. Simply removing monotonous roles allows for more development, more feedback and more time without error or disruptions. What would also change is how we could interact with others around us, with virtual assistants such as Amazon’s Alexa, Apple’s Siri and Google Assistant, chatbots could provide so much utility for users and their families. Chatbots could be seen in use for various jobs and could provide a much quicker alternative to completing simple tasks. In regards how it could impact my daily life, it would allow me to organize my information and be more concise with how I could handle my workload.  The impact in small communities from family members to friends and colleagues would only be small in detail but wide in a general perspective as effectiveness and time are more valued in our fast information era society where we need everything in a push of a button or a swipe of a finger. Families could be using chatbots to sync and communicate time and work with each member like an individual using it to organizing their work and time. Friends could develop stronger relationships through chatterbots where they could even become the replacement for friends yet, the current chatterbots and NPL could be far from being able to even accomplishing that task at the moment. Overall, Chatterbots and Natural Processing Language will create meaningful impact on a large and small scale; creating opportunity for growth in individuals, communities and businesses.
