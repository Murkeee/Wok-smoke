        Matt had stated that he wants to be a 'Chief Information Security Officer' (CISO) but looking through the "Skills Priority List Occupation.pdf" the only job title that relates to the topic is a Chief Information Officer. A Chief Information Officer has a strong future demand yet currently there is no national shortage.

        Tyson mentions that he wants to be a Network Infrastructure Architect. The official job title for the role would be either Network Administrator or Computer Network and Systems Engineer. Network Administrator is in high demand but there is a high number of Network Administrator in Australia same with Computer Network and System Engineer where there is an abundant amount of Computer Network and System Engineer yet there are strong demand for more.

          Justin had said that he wants to be either a "web developer" "or a field in cybersecurity". The official job titles for these roles are Web developer and ICT Security Specialist or Security Consultant. According to "Skills Priority List Occupation.pdf" it says that ICT Security Specialist are in national shortage and is strong future demand, Security Consultant are not in national shortage but are still in high demand same with web developer, they are not in national shortage but are still strong in future demand.

          Dylan noted that he wants to be a web designer and the proper job title is exactly what it states: a website designer. Website designers are not in national shortage but are in high demand, this means that in the whole country of Australia there are plenty of web designers yet the job is still in strong demand.

    So out of the job titles in the group the highest demanding would be ICT Security Specialist as there is a high demand for them yet a low number of them available to fulfil the demand. The other job titles are in the same category of the job role being in high demand but not in national shortage, yet the rank in terms of demand for employees are Chief Information Officer, web designer, web developer, computer network and systems engineer, network administrator and lastly security consultant.
    <br>
    </br>

  <p>
    Currently the highest demanding IT-specific skill, and is required within the group would be the python programming language, with this skill it would be more required in other job titles than others yet it was named "the most in-demand skill for 2020 across nine of our global markets" Another IT-specific skill would be networking, with the web growing everyday so the demand for people with the knowledge would be valued so within the group many of the job titles would need to know the skills for networking. One more skill that is IT-specific and is ranked highly would be technical support, despite being an easy skill with now a days technology being everywhere the need for tech support is growing, so by having this skill under our belt would show employers they can have you help around and technical difficulties.
    <br>
    </br>
  </p>

  <p>
    Particular jobs require skills set that are rank higher than other jobs, so many of the skill required would differ depending on the job. Overall the general skills that are required for the group would be communication/teamwork as so jobs would require you to talk to clients or speck to other co workers about the task in hand. Another skill would be time management, with this skill set it would allow you to be on track, which comes in handy when submitting something on the due date. One more important general skill would be critical thinking as employers would want their employees to think critically in times of important as it shows you are able to think on your feet and don't have to wait for orders.

  <p>
    The three highest ranked IT-specific skills that are not required for my groups would be Machine learning, Linux and quality assurance. Machine learning is a broad skill relates to AI and how it is built/programmed. The next skill is knowing how to operate/program Linux, Linus is a operating system that compete against Microsoft Windows yet the demand for skilled individual that knows how to work with it are limited. Another skill that is highly sort out but is not required within the group would be Quality assurance this is where you make sure the product is done right and minimal errors.
    <br>
    </br>
  </p>

  <p>
    The three highest ranked general skills are writing skills, positive attitude and resilience. Writing skill despite being used everyday from things like messaging family or emailing others but writing skills is not a necessity as the bulk thing are mainly programming and not really report writing. The other skill that is not in our group required skill set is positive attitude, technically you don't need to be in a positive attitude when you're working behind a screen yet the only time this appeals would be to others such as co-works or customers but since working in the IT department you don't really need to communicate too much. Since majority of the job doesn't require us to work with client/customers being resilience is not required since we would spend most of our time at computers completing task rather than dealing with customers and being resilience if they act out of hand.

    Yes, as the significance of soft and baseline skills seems to be very crucial. As not only does one need the requirements and skills to undertake their ideal job. Common and important skills such as writing, communication, positivity, resilience, teamwork, problem solving, and organisation are in high demand in the IT. Nonetheless its good to know what other baseline or soft skills are in demand even if their demand is lower. The data has shown what generic and IT related skills are the most important. Apart from the newfound importance of baseline and soft skills. The opinion of our ideal jobs hasn’t changed as one way, or another every job solves problem in one capacity or another. Also, we knew what requirements and skills we needed to have to shoulder our ideal jobs. But still yet it’s better to know what the top IT skills are, so that it could be possible to build these skills and add more value to ourselves when trying to get into the field of IT.
