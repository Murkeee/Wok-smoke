    <p>Jay is a security enthusiast who specialises in offensive security, currently leading an offensive security team at one of Australia’s largest financial organisations. He has a strong interest in cloud and container security and is passionate about helping his customers identify and secure their systems. - "https://www.crestcon.org/au/attend-schedule/"</p>
    <p>Jay works on the offensive side so this is where you "pretend to be the attacker and try and attack the systems and applications". As a manager in the cybersecurity sector there lots of people you would have to interact with, but the important ones would be the stakeholders so the business stakeholders, technical stakeholders, and there's risk stakeholders. Jay works with them to help determine what issues need to be fixed, and what issues don't necessarily need to be fixed.</p>
